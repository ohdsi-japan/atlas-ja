Summary statistics of these person level covariates may be count, mean, sd, var, min, max, median, range, and quantiles. In addition, covariates during a period may be stratified into temporal units of time for time-series analysis such as fixed intervals of time relative to cohort_start_date (e.g. every 7 days, every 30 days etc.), or in absolute calendar intervals such as calendar-week, calendar-month, calendar-quarter, calendar-year.","Remove","Feature analyses","Name","Submit","Create new parameter","Value","New parameter","Feature analyses parameters","Loading Cohort Characterization design...","Subgroup name is empty.","Subgroup name is duplicated.","Strata name","New subgroup","No subgroups defined","Stratified by","Calculate subgroup analyses only","Subgroup analyses","Executions","All strata","Explore","Loading prevalence stats...","Cohort:","Exploring concept hierarchy for:","Ancestor","Descendant","Selected","Date:","Design:","Results:","<%= reports %> reports","Exploring","Export all","Analyses","Cohorts","Domains","Hide Empty Results","Loading execution results...","Show All Results","Export comparison","Apply","Filter results to covariates with prevalence greater than:","Threshold value","Viewing most prevalent <%=resultsCountFiltered%> of total <%=totalResultsCount%> records","Reports for <%= sourceName %>","Series","Covariate","All prevalence covariates","Design","Executions","Utilities","Versions","Messages","Utilities","Design","Concept Sets","Add Criteria feature","Add New Criteria...","Analysis SQL:","Analysis type:","Available variables:","all variables specified in Cohort Characterization parameters","Feature Analysis #<%=id%>","Copied To Clipboard!","Copy Analysis SQL Template To Clipboard","Criteria","Criteria name","Custom","Description","Design","Design or Name are empty","Domain:","FeatureExtraction preset name:","Loading Feature Analysis list...","A feature analysis with this name already exists.
