One person may qualify for one cohort multiple times during non-overlapping time intervals. Cohorts are constructed in ATLAS by specifying cohort entry criteria and cohort exit criteria. Cohort entry criteria involve selecting one or more initial events, which determine the start date for cohort entry, and optionally specifying additional inclusion criteria which filter to the qualifying events. Cohort exit criteria are applied to each cohort entry record to determine the end date when the person’s episode no longer qualifies for the cohort.","Cohort Definition","This link can be used to access this cohort definition directly from the WebAPI from other tools like R as well as for importing across ATLAS instances.","Link to Cohort Definition","Configure reports to run","Run","Close cohort definition","Generation Exit Message","retrieving cohort definitions","Cohort Not Generated","Whoops","The reporting system has encountered an error.
